<h1>Getting help</h1>

This is merely the quick start guide. We also provide a [reference manual](../reference/index.md) as well as [guides for specific use cases](../guides/index.md).

However, sometimes the best documentation can leave you stuck with an issue. If you need help, want to discuss a topic around ContainerSSH, or have feedback you can use our [GitHub Discussions Board](https://github.com/ContainerSSH/ContainerSSH/discussions) to post a question.
